# Barbershop

Hi! I'm Oksana and this is my first individual Frontend project - simple single-page website, which introduces a barbershop. 
This project is built by Parcel. You can easily view it on any device you want, because it's design is adaptive.

## Structure

1. In Header you can find navigation by page sections. 
   In mobile version mobile menu can be opened by click on the burger-button.   
2. Simple slider in this section is present. You can view background-images by clicking on buttons 'back' and 'forward' in tablet and desktop versions, 
   or by tapping a button in a mobile version. Slider is made by JavaScript, no libraries were used.
3. Main content of this page consists of five sections: 'About', 'Services and Prices', 'Advantages', 'Barbers', 'Gallery'.

## Achievements

When preparing this project I have improved my skills in:
- HTML & CSS (SCSS is used here)
- JavaScript
- Code optimization
- Time-managment
- Self-motivation

It's a pleasure to me - share my work which is already completed. I'm glad to see your feedback on this project.
